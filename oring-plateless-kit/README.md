![Render](./render.png)

The kit will clip to the PCB and act as a holder to put the PCB above the O-ring posts.

The file is designed for TPU printed, optimized for Nozzle 0.2mm print. Only works with 1.6mm PCB. The hardness is about 75A-90A O-ring.

The file was tested and worked with Unikorn, and should work with 1-piece O-ring mount keyboard, or 2-piece O-ring mount with inner top and bottom case aligned.

In case the inside of the case is too loose, you can use tapes in the inner case to reduce the space.
